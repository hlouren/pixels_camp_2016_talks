Description
-----------

Last year I had a water infiltration problem in my living room. The source of the problem was found and fixed, but I was
left with a nasty looking hole right in the middle of the ceiling. I found this the perfect opportunity to put into
practice a lighting project that I was thinking about for some time: why not cover (most of) the ceiling with leds?

I was already using led strips in other projects. These are a special kind of led strips in which you have individual control
over the color of each led - if you Google for WS2801, WS2812, APA102 and the like you'll know what I mean.

So I embarked in this long adventure of designing and implementing a rather large matrix of 2304 leds (a 32 by 72 matrix) in
my own ceiling.

In this talk I'll tell you about the project itself and the challenges I faced, both at the hardware and software level.


Speaker Bio
-----------

I've been using computers since the time of the venerable ZX Spectrum. Soon after convicing my parents to buy me one,
I spent most of my time tweaking with it rather than playing games on it.

From there on computers never left me. I've graduated in Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico in 1997, and my
professional live has been mostly in the Software Engineering positions. I've been at OutSystems for 11 years, where I've
been proudly involved in the design and development of many of the great features of the OutSystems Platform.

My hobbies are quite varied, ranging from gardening and playing the piano to home automation.
